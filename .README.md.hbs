{{pkg.description}}

If you want seriously reduce your data size, consider using [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html).

Use compressed-json only if you cannot handle binary for some reason.


## Install

```bash
npm i compressed-json
```

## Usage

```js
{{{render 'example/usage.js'}}}
```

## How It Works

compressed-json has two logics:

* [Key-Compression](#key-compression-logic)
* [String-Value-Pointing](#string-value-pointing-logic)

### Example compression

**example-src.json**

```json
{{{render 'example/example-src.json'}}}
```

**example-compressed.json**

```json
{{{render 'example/example-compressed.json'}}}
```

### Structure of compressed json

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `K` | Array of original keys. Object keys are replaced with index of `K` in the compressed json |
| `P` | Pointed string values. Values are replaced with index of `P` in the compressed json |
| `_` | Compressed payload. Keeps original structure, but keys and values may be replaced with pointers to `K` or `P` |


<a name="key-compression-logic"/>

### Key-Compression logic

All object keys are replaced with index of array stored in `K` of compressed JSON.

The more same key appears in original json, the more better compression.

<a name="string-value-pointing-logic" />

### String-Value-Pointing

String values appeared at least two will replaced with pointer string with contains index of array stored in `P` of compressed JSON.

The more same string value appears in original json, the more better compression.
